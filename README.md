Single Page ReactJS Application for learning React Router purposes.  
In this project I'm learning the react router v6 where I build different Routes, Links, NavLinks, Params, NestedRoutes, Redirecting, Handling not found route, Query parameters and more!  
I also created custom hook for fetching and storing data in a firebase backend.
